<img src="media/hpp_home.png" width="800" height="200">

# Objective:
The primary objective of the House Price Analysis & Prediction project is to develop a robust and accurate machine learning model that can analyze and predict the prices of properties in Bangalore. We will first build a model using sklearn and linear regression using banglore home prices dataset from kaggle.com. Second step would be to write a python flask server that uses the saved model to serve http requests. Third component is the website built in html & css  that allows user to enter home square ft area, bedrooms etc and it will call python flask server to retrieve the predicted price.<br>
The specific objectives include:<br>
1. Data Collection, Exploration and Preprocessing.
2. Exploratory Data Analysis.
3. Feature Selection and Engineering.
4. Machine Learning Model Development.
5. Website Development
